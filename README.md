I'm a front-end developer from Krasnodar, Russia, and my name is bbartem. Despite being a student, I have some prior employment experience. C#, C++, and JavaScript are among the programming languages in which I am well-versed, and I have experience as a front-end developer. MegaPilot, an Arduino-based automation system for regulating church sound, is one of the projects in my portfolio. I adore web development and am always learning new technologies and tools to advance my knowledge.
